1. Don't put everything in an index.js file
2. Watch Cernan's videos - GREAT example of how to pass the project - VERY advanced tho
3. Watch Micah's videos too

- Write the backend FIRST, front end SECOND

Project Idea: Single page Timed Trivia App (inspired by Sporkle)

- User can pick a multiple choice quiz to take from several categories
- User has 2 minutes to complete quiz of 10 questions, their score will be tracked 
- After they finish the quiz, they are presented with their score, can go back to home page and take additional quizzes

- Update, can have a user rating system

QUESTIONS FOR MICAH:

1. Where is the CRUD in this context?  - READ and UPDATE (will be handled by user upvoting the quiz)
2. Check models + relationships: ALL SET
3. Do I need to set anything up on the back end to track the score or can that all be handled on front end?: This can be handled on front end (note: if the user refreshes the page they will lose their score
4. Async request: where are the opportunities to do that in this context? (is it in the timer), etc?:

- this will be the fetch calls to the server

RAILS BACKEND (not trying to overcomplicate this):
1. Should contain the API of the quizzes + their answers, which will be rendered as JSON

Models: 
- Quiz (has_many :questions, belongs_to :category)
- Question (belongs_to :quiz) - DOn't need a separate answer model because the answer can just be part of the question's object
- Category: (has_many :quizzes)



Controllers:
- QuizController (index, show): what kinda controller actions should there be? Index, show, update
- QuestionController: index, show
- Category: index, show

Schema:
Quiz:
- t.string :title
- t.text :description
- t.integer :category_id

Category 
- t.string :name
- t.string :description

Question:
- t.string :prompt
- t.text :content - this will be an array of the questions
- t.string :correct_answer
- t.integer :quiz_id


JS FRONTEND
1. Renders quizzes (and their questions) as JSON to the page 
2. User answers the question correctly, they advance to the next question. If they get a question wrong, they receive alert (with red styling to indicate wrong), then next question is rendered.
3. After they finish quiz, they're given summary of their total score.

Update system for each quiz, user can give upvote or downvote - refer to google material icons for the thumbs up . THIS IS THE UPDATE ACTION, THIS WILL NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED
