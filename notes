Best Practice Checklist:

JavaScript
[ ] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
[ ] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
[ ] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).
Rails
[ ] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
[ ] Well-named variables and methods
[ ] Short, single-purpose methods
Git
[ ] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
[ ] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
[ ] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Don't put everything in an index.js file
2. Watch Cernan's videos - GREAT example of how to pass the project - VERY advanced tho
3. Watch Micah's videos too

- Write the backend FIRST, front end SECOND

Project Idea: Single page Timed Trivia App (inspired by Sporkle)

- User can pick a multiple choice quiz to take from several categories
- User has 2 minutes to complete quiz of 10 questions, their score will be tracked 
- After they finish the quiz, they are presented with their score, can go back to home page and take additional quizzes

- Update, can have a user rating system

QUESTIONS FOR MICAH:

1. Where is the CRUD in this context?  - READ and UPDATE (will be handled by user upvoting the quiz)
2. Check models + relationships: ALL SET
3. Do I need to set anything up on the back end to track the score or can that all be handled on front end?: This can be handled on front end (note: if the user refreshes the page they will lose their score
4. Async request: where are the opportunities to do that in this context? (is it in the timer), etc?:

- this will be the fetch calls to the server

RAILS BACKEND (not trying to overcomplicate this):
1. Should contain the API of the quizzes + their answers, which will be rendered as JSON

Models: 
- Quiz (has_many :questions, belongs_to :category)
- Question (belongs_to :quiz) - DOn't need a separate answer model because the answer can just be part of the question's object
- Category: (has_many :quizzes)



Controllers:
- QuizController (index, show): what kinda controller actions should there be? Index, show, update
- QuestionController: index, show
- Category: index, show

Schema:
Quiz:
- t.string :title
- t.text :description
- t.integer :category_id

Category 
- t.string :name
- t.string :description

Question:
- t.string :prompt
- t.text :content - this will be an array of the questions
- t.string :correct_answer
- t.integer :quiz_id


JS FRONTEND
1. Renders quizzes (and their questions) as JSON to the page 
2. User answers the question correctly, they advance to the next question. If they get a question wrong, they receive alert (with red styling to indicate wrong), then next question is rendered.
3. After they finish quiz, they're given summary of their total score.

Update system for each quiz, user can give upvote or downvote - refer to google material icons for the thumbs up . THIS IS THE UPDATE ACTION, THIS WILL NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED


Tasks - To be done while following along with Cernan's videos
1. Build controllers + their actions - DONE
2. Build models - DONE
3. Migrate Database - DONE
4. Associate models - DONE
5. Seed Database - DONE
6. Check that relationships make sense - DONE
7. Add JSON Fast serializer gem - DONE
8. Configure file tree for serializer (look at previous lesson on it) - DONE
9. JSON data rendering on localhost - DONE
10. Figure out CORS issue - DONE
11. Verify fetch is working -  DONE
12. Seed Database with 1 more quiz - DONE
13. append trivia names to the DOM - DONE
14. Render category names to the DOM - DONE
16. append quiz questions to the DOM - DONE
17. create basic quiz form template - DONE
18. Add buttons to make sure we can "enter" that quiz - DONE
19. make category names clickable (event listeners here) - DONE, returns the category name selected
- check params for params[:category] to see if it exists - DONE
- if it does, get that category using Category.find_by_name(params[:category]) - DONE
- then return the json version of category.quizzes - DONE
- need to write function that takes the dataset id of the category I select, fetches that data by that id number - DONE
- click a category -> got the associated category's quizzes - DONE

Current:

1. Need to map thru those quizzes, add them to the DOM by name 
2. Add event listener to the quiz name -> render the start option to begin the quiz






18. Make sure The prompt + multiple choices are rendering

- MAIN focus: watch the youtube tutorial, follow the pattern to create the quiz form 
- the app will be almost all pagination
- Quiz is essentially a giant form with radio for choices you can make 
- When you submit that form, the answers you picked are evaluated and compared to whats listed as the correct answers
- your score increases accordingly
- final score is rendered back to the browser once you complete all the questions
